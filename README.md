Deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are powerful classification models but require a large amount of training data. In niche domains such as bird acoustics, it is expensive and difficult to obtain a large number of training samples. One method of classifying data with a limited number of training samples is to employ transfer learning. In this research, we evaluated the effectiveness of birdcall classification using transfer learning from a larger base dataset (2814 samples in 46 classes) to a smaller target dataset (351 samples in 10 classes) using the ResNet-50 CNN. We obtained 79% average validation accuracy on the target dataset in 5-fold cross-validation. The methodology of transfer learning from an ImageNet-trained CNN to a project-specific and a much smaller set of classes and images was extended to the domain of spectrogram images, where the base dataset effectively played the role of the ImageNet.
